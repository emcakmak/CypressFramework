# Cypress Test Automation

This repo contains a very basic example of a Test Automation framework built using a tool called [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), which is an end-to-end testing tool used to test anything that runs in a browser (as long as it's on Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge).



## What does this repo contain?

Basic tests that cover some potential scenarios a user might face on this practice website for [Automation Testing Practice](https://testautomationpractice.blogspot.com/). They can be found in the cypress directory under e2e in the basicFunctionality.cy.js file.

```bash
